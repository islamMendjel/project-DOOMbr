# Notes:
# - This workflow builds the DOOM engine to WebAssembly using Emscripten
# - The emsdk installation may take a few minutes on first run (cached afterwards)
# - Build artifacts are deployed to the gh-pages branch
# - Ensure GitHub Pages is configured to serve from gh-pages branch in repository settings
# - The build.sh script will create placeholder files if no source code is present
